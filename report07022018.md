# Summary as of 7th February 2018

## What is Blocking Us / Issues
* Access to the building is still a substantial blocker - this is the sixth week that this has been a problem. Marvell-Consulting have managed to arrange alternative temporary accomodation, but it is not ideal. A security waiver for Lunar house is not possible

## Just Done
* Research plan approved Tuesday 6th Feb
* Agreed sample of users to contact for the next three iterations of research engagement
* Established KPI's and begun baseline measurements 
* Gathered establishment licence statistics from ASPEL  which will inform profiles for user research
* Completed content audit for gov.uk ASL
* Team members were introduced to the Home Office research and design community in a meetup
* The team met with a cross-government licensing team at GDS to understand commonalities 
* Captured actions arising from last week's governance meeting
* Team members met with service standards team to discuss the way we plan to assess our service

## About to Do/Doing
* Today we will plan our activities for the next two weeks in sprint planning. 
* The main activities that will be planned will be the research, design prototype activities that have been outlined in the approved research plan
* This will likely focus initially on viewing the establishment licence

## Things to be aware of
* Mick Carling will not be working with us after the end of the week
* Project risks have been moved from Jira to Trello (both are issue tracking systems)
