## About to Do/Doing
* Recruiting two more establishments - user research
* Planning the discussion guide for the sessions - user research
* Improvements to the search interface following on from elastic search - design
* First draft of content for users submitting a retrospective assessment - content design
* Rebuild of training certificate interfaces - working software

## Things to bear in mind

The work the research and design team begun on PPL assessments for inspectors earlier this year, was put on hold until the research and design work for the following had been completed:

* Education and training PPLs
* Category E PILs
* Secondary availability on PPLs
* PPL holder training

This work has now been designed and tested, and has now been delivered (in the case of E&T PPLs) or is being built.

The research and design team is currently working on retrospective assessments, after which they will be returning to the PPL assessment work.
