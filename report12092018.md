# Summary as of 12th September 2018

# Sprint 16 - Mid Sprint
 
## What's Blocking us / Issues
* We have added the risk "We cannot deal with amendments to PPLs held in the current system." 
* We have also substantially increased the risk that "We build the wrong thing because we can't get the information we need or it takes too long to get it." 
* Both of these risks have mitigation strategies in place.

## Just Done
* Designed Approve/Reject a PIL application - inspector view
* Content review of all external facing journeys
* developed a research and design plan for PPLs and started user recruitment
* Developed Conversion of UI to use HO design system
* Held a governance meeting and signed of Statement of Work 4 (1 October 2018 - 31 March 2019)
* New authority to operate signed off for data migration

## About to Do/Doing
* Build applicant-facing PIL application journey
* Test inspector journey for PIL application with inspectors
* Map the "designed universe" - what we've designed so far, and what we still need to design

## Things to be aware of
* A new designer will join the team next week
