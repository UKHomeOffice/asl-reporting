# Completed this Sprint
We completed 7 issues this Sprint as listed below:
1) We re-arranged the sequence of animals used and re-used and reworded the questions for clarity and ease of selection and narrative.

4) We added a declaration statement on the Named Person's journey to the inspectors' screen.
5) We added an additional column for PPL number to the establishment RoPs list to make clear which project licences are included on the returns.

Interesting fact about Pangolins: They are mostly found in Africa and Asia. They have muscular probing tongues to forage for food, mostly ants and can deploy a harsh odour to ward of predators.
