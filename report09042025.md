3) We added the licence fees information to ASPeL for this current financial year 25/26.
4) We removed information from an additional location on protocols for a user where it was wrongly displayed.
5) We upgraded almost all the expired components within ASPeL to make it much more efficient for development work
6) Our Design team completed designs for previewing standard protocols in project licence applications
7) We fixed the erros on the establishment fees page when PIL start date is invalid.
