## New Features!
We've just released some new features to make ASPeL quicker and easier to use!

1. You can now add or edit a condition within an Establishment License amendment task rather than navigating to the License to make the changes.
2. We've included a link to Project License application guidance on the application form

Don't forget to check out our [roadmap](https://roadmap.prodpad.com/937455be-8d08-11ed-aa53-2a7db0eb1d9c) to see what's coming next to ASPeL.


### These are the areas of focus for the current sprint
1. Get Corporate PEL ready for development
2. Security improvements
3. Deliver an improvement to how Project License conditions are managed
4. Content Designer handover


## Things to bear in mind
We welcome a new Content Designer to the team next week.

An adult flamingo's plumage ranges from light pink to bright red in colour due to aqueous bacteria and beta-carotene obtained from their food supply.
