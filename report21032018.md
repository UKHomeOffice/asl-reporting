# Summary as of 21st March 2018 
## What's Blocking Us / Issues
* Two members of the team do not have security clearance, this makes having meetings in Lunar house and other Home Office establishments more difficult to arrange
* We have learned that new members of the team require security clearance before they can be given a Home Office digital email account

## Just Done
* Presented roadmap to ASRU leadership team
* Reviewed KPIs with service owner
* Export any page of the prototype to a PDF document
* Summarised research findings and presented at show and tell
* Continued research inspectors view of animal licensing

## About to Do/Doing
* User studies using prototypes with HOLCs: view establishment details
* PDFs of sorted and filtered establishment data

## Things to be aware of
* Two new team members will join next week, an interation designer and a software developer
