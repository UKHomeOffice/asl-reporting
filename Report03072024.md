Fun facts about aye-aye: The aye-aye is believed to be the world's weirdest primate. Being a primate means that it is related to humans, though it looks like a rodent.




 

## Planned for Sprint 146 (aye-aye)
1) We aim to complete the implementation of a better user experience for those choosing to keep animals alive	on ASPeL	
2) We will continue to onboard additional joiners as they land
3) We are continuing the work to further reduce the Tech Debt on ASPeL, this will serve to mitigate security risks on ASPeL
5) We started the work that will ensure ASPeL is compliant with accessibility standards
6) Developers will apply fixes to issues reported on reusable steps which has meant that the highlighting are inconsistent with expectations 
7) We will design the new journey for GA Standard protocols as the first of the planned improvements to project licence applications.
