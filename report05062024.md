2) Our user researcher is aiming to recruit external users for usability research on the Named People journey
3) We will continue to onboard additional joiners as they land
4) We are start work to further reduce the Tech Debt on ASPeL
5) We will be planning the work that will ensure ASPeL is compliant with accessibility standards
6) Developers will review and apply fixes to issues reported on reusable steps which meant that the highlighting were inconsistent with expectations 
7) We will define content and behaviour requirements for one Standard protocol ahead of design work on project licence improvements
