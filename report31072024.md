Fun facts about aye-aye: The aye-aye is believed to be the world's weirdest primate. Although being a primate means that it is related to humans, it looks more like a rodent.


# Completed this Sprint: 146 (aye-aye)
1) We completed the work of tidying up the ASPeL Repositories to improve deployments for developers.
2) We discovered that the change highlighting did not display the expected colour changes on the comparison page due to ASPeL misreading the formatting used. 
     a) We applied a fix and correct colour highlighting is now displayed in ASPeL when users have entered single line texts
     b) Another fix now displays colour changes correctly when users have selected options with radio buttons.
     c) Also colour changes now display correctlty when users have used check boxes to select options for action plans
3) We applied a fix to make step headers in protocols visible to users who reported that they had been obscured and made invisible. 
4) We completed the analysis of usability testing findings
5) We added the NTCO application journey to the prototype of Named Persons
6) The plan for the design of named persons work has started.
