Fun facts about aye-aye: The aye-aye is believed to be the world's weirdest primate. Although being a primate means that it is related to humans, it looks more like a rodent.


# Completed this Sprint: 146 (aye-aye)
1) We completed the work of tidying up the ASPeL data storehouse to improve deployments for developers.
2) We discovered that the change highlighting did not always display the expected colour changes on the comparison page due to ASPeL misreading the formatting used. 
     a) We applied a fix and correct colour highlighting is now displayed in ASPeL when users have entered single line texts
     b) When users have selected options with radio buttons, such as 'Yes' or 'No'.
     c) And colour changes now display correctlty when users have used check boxes to select options for action plans
3) We applied a fix to make steps' headers in protocols visible to users who reported that headers in steps had been obscured making them invisible. 
4) We completed the analysis of usability testing research for Named Persons
5) We added the NTCO application journey to the prototype of Named Persons
6) The plan for the design of Named Persons work has started.
