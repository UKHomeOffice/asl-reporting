# Completed Sprint: 151(Fairy Wren)

1) We implemented PIL E improvements which include creating a functionality for: a) detailed course purpose for both Training and Higher   Education, b)mandatory fields, c)hint texts, d)a word count limit on free text fields, and e) making course purpose to display in PIL-E personal licence screen.
2) We created a wordcount component which we can reuse for all ASPeL free text fields 
3) Based on feedback, we simplified the RoP procedure response to 'Yes' or 'No' -on the question-'is this an endangered specie?'
4) We got NACWO and NVS guides published in gov.uk

Fun facts about Grizzly Bear: Meriwether Lewis and William Clarke: first described them as grisley, which could be interpreted as either "grizzly" (i.e., "grizzled"—that is, with grey-tipped hair) or "grisly" ("fear-inspiring", now usually "gruesome"). 





## Planned for this Sprint 152 (Grizzly Bear)

1) We will continue work to improve licencing data description for annual reports
2) Continue ASL Schema updates to improve ASPeL internally
3) Continue improvements to the establishments page on Gov.uk 
4) Ensure animals already cited as endangered in RoP are not later deselected by users.
5) Standardise authourisation for rehoming and set free to improve efficiencies in time and effort for users.
6) Continue Named Person improvements 
7) NTS publishing improvements
8) Design a single GA Standard protocol
9) We will insert a link from a Named Person application page to the guides stored on the gov.uk site, for users' convenience.
