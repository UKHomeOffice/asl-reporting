Fun facts about Grizzly Bear:Meriwether Lewis and William Clarke: first described them as grisley, which could be interpreted as either "grizzly" (i.e., "grizzled"—that is, with grey-tipped hair) or "grisly" ("fear-inspiring", now usually "gruesome").





# Completed Sprint: 152(Grizzly Bear)

1) In preparation for improvements to protocols administration, we have defined editable content for standard protocols
2) We got NACWO and NVS guides published on GOV.UK to help those nominating Named persons for roles in establishments
3) We ensured that when endangered species in RoP has been selected on the form, this information cannot be changed later.
4) We added 2026 Bank Holidays to ASPeL
