Fun facts about Grizzly Bear:Meriwether Lewis and William Clarke: first described them as grisley, which could be interpreted as either "grizzly" (i.e., "grizzled"—that is, with grey-tipped hair) or "grisly" ("fear-inspiring", now usually "gruesome").





# Completed Sprint: 152(Grizzly Bear)

In preparation for improvements to protocols administration, we have defined editable content for standard protocols
We got NACWO and NVS guides published on GOV.UK to help those nominating Named persons for roles in establishments
We ensured endangered species in RoP once cited on the RoP form cannot be changed
We added 2026 Bank Holidays to ASPeL

## Planned for this Sprint 152 (Grizzly Bear)
WE will;
1) Continue work to improve licencing data description for annual reports
2) Continue ASL Schema updates to improve ASPeL internally
3) Continue improvements to the establishments page on Gov.uk 
4) Ensure animals already cited as endangered in RoP remain cited in other parts of the process for consistency.
5) Standardise authourisation for rehoming and set free to improve efficiencies in time and effort for users.
6) Continue Named Person improvements 
7) Make NTS publishing improvements
8) Design a single GA Standard protocol
9) Insert a link from a Named Person application page to the guides stored on the gov.uk site, for users' convenience.
