# Summary as of 9th May 2018 
## What's Blocking us / Issues
* The data exporting functionality in ASPeL cannot be used reliably. Suppliers have said they will not give us access to their database. We need a way to access the underlying data from ASPeL to import it into our systems for private beta. 

## Just Done
* Validating of user journeys with licencing staff
* Created backlog of user stories for private beta mapped to identified user needs
* Finished establishment landing page and licensed premises page for beta


## About to Do/Doing
* User Research with Inspectors using new prototypes
* Development of the Establishment details page for establishment users for beta
* Development of the user feedback page for use in beta

## Things to be aware of
* The team will most likely move back into Lunar house at the beginning of June
