# Summary as of 4th April 2018 
## What's Blocking us / Issues
* Our desks in Lunar House have been reallocated due to underuse (cause by difficulty of access due to slow grant of security clearance)
* We are still experiencing administrative difficulties with the security clearance/Lunar House building pass process
	1. We were not notified when one team member was granted security clearance
	2. Another team member has still not been able to get a Lunar House building pass because security clearance has been granted with the wrong date of birth, despite attempts to correct the error

## Just Done
* Processed research findings resulting from the user research that we did last week at the HOLTIC meeting
* Demonstrated working software for download of filtered content to pdf

## About to Do/Doing
* Produce designs of an "ASRU view of establishments"
* Conduct futher research with the Inspectors and Licensing Team
* Develop "download to csv" functionality
* Deploy existing software to a pre-production environment

## Things to be aware of
* This was a short week since it included the Easter weekend
* A new user researcher has joined the team
* We have received all outputs from the continuous improvement unit's recommendations
