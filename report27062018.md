# Summary as of 27th June 2018 
# Sprint 11
## What's Blocking us / Issues
We have added two potential risks to the risk register to be discussed at next meeting:
* On the back of receiving Authority to Operate (ATO) we are sensitive that there might be issues regarding data quality which may need addressing
* We have highlighted in retrospective the need to limit and control scope through user research/design and development

## Just Done
* Develop working software for add/remove room from external users
* Design iterations of inbox and amendment journeys for all views
* User research with inspectors for add a room as part of amending an establishment licence

## About to Do/Doing
* Development of working software for the "end to end" amendment journey
* Incorporation of findings from user research with HOLCs and inspectors into designs
* Iteration of designs for inboxes for inspectors and HOLCs

## Things to be aware of
* Tomorrow the team are running a combination "Show and Tell" and research event with 40+ HOLCs
