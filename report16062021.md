## Weekly summary
Several selected establishment users have now completed and submitted ROPs. We are continuing to respond to their feedback from the experience. 

It has been agreed that research on reusable components for PPL applications with establishment users will go ahead. 

## Just Done
* Recruited PPL applicants to test reusable steps in protocols - user research
* Prepared our approach for the testing - user research
* Creating prototypes for testing reusable steps in protocols  - design
* Fixed issues with NVS and NACWOs not being unassigned from approved areas when their roles were removed - working software
* Initial work on advanced filters in project search - working software
* Initial work in improved AWERB metadata in PPL endorsement journey - working software

## About to Do/Doing
* Session with an establishment to gather feedback on the new RoPs process in ASPeL - user research
* Testing prototypes and iterating - design & user research
* Further work on advanced filters in project search - working software
* Further work on improved AWERB metadata in PPL endorsement journey - working software
* Improve performance of aggregated licence fee data pages - working software
