# Completed this Sprint
1) We have added some further updates to the Named Person roles nominations guides to help establishment in completing nominations for various roles. However, we have not yet made them available to users.
2) We have tidied up complications with ROP counts which were reflecting wrongly when a project licence is transferred between establishments. For example, notifications of falsely 'overdue' ROPs will no longer show in the original establishment's RoPs summary page. But the new establishment will be notified to submit a RoP if there is an overdue RoP. This is because RoPs move with Project licences.
3) We have implemented changes within ASPeL which enhance our capability for deploying completed work at a quicker pace.
4) The user researcher has played back to designers, team and ASRU the findings of the user research that was done on standard protocols improvements work. Thank you to all volunteers that helped with the process.
5) The standard protocols design prototype is now in review.
6) We added a 'revoke' button to enable PIL users who cannot revoke their Personal Licences when stuck between establishments to release such licences.
