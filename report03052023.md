# Summary as of Wednesday 3rd May 2023

## New Features

**Category E Licenses**

We are now testing prototypes for the new PIL E experience. We're interested in speaking with Establishment License Holders and Administrators who deal with Category E Training & Higher Education licenses. Please get in touch if you're interested in taking part.


**Corporate Establishments** is now Live! 

Every Establishment License will now either be categorised as 'Corporate PEL' or 'Individual PEL'.

Corporate PELs have a Named Person Responsible for Compliance but will also now be required to provide contact details for an individual legally responsible for the company or organisation (such as a company secretary).

Individual PEL Establishment Licenses have a PEL Holder, who is the legally responsible person.
