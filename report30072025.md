# Completed this Sprint
We completed the following:
1) We completed further improvements to the Named Persons' application process in the area of declarations and NVS module details, these changes remain behind the feature flag
2) We fixed the problem that prevented NTS Reduction changes to be highlighted correctly, now the animal count before and after changes are highlighted correctly.
3) We added a warning to the PEL Holder to download any RoPs attached to a project licence prior to transfer to another establishment.
4) We have tested the Named Persons' improvement work done and will continue until all work is completed.
5) In testing and for imminent release: We have improved the sequence of writing or answering the animals re-used question.
6) In testing and for imminent release: We have fixed a bug preventing New Comments from appearing on protocols which prevents inspectors from commenting on the protocols and project titles.
7) In testing and for imminent release: We have added a project licence number column for establishments on RoPs returns.
