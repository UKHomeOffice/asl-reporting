# Completed this Sprint
We completed the following:
1) Further improvements to Named persons' role nominations, which have been added behind the feature flag
2) We fixed the problem that prevented NTS Reduction changes to be highlighted correctly, now the animal count before and after changes are highlighted correctly.
3) We completed further improvements to the Named Persons' application process in the area of declarations and NVS module details, these changes remain behind the feature flag
4) We added a warning to the PEL Holder to download any RoPs attached to a Project licence before it is transferred out of the establishment
5) We are testing the Named Persons' improvement work as development progresses before we declare everything Done.
6) In testing and for imminent release: We have improved the sequence of writing or answering the animals re-used question.
7) In testing and for imminent release: A bug preventing New Comments from appearing on protocols which prevents inspectors from commenting on protocols and project titles.
8) In testing and for imminent release: We have added a column for establishments to add Project Licence number to RoPs returns
