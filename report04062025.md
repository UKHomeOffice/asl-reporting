# Completed this Sprint
1) We have added some further updates to the Named roles nominations guides to support establishments nominating people for the roles. Users will not see these changes until all is done and tested.
2) We have tidied up complications with ROP counts which were displaying incorrectly as 'outstanding' when a project licence is transferred between establishments. Such notifications have been removed from the original establishment's RoPs summary page. But the new establishment will be notified to submit a RoP if there is an overdue RoP. This aligns with the fact that RoPs move with Project licences.
3) We have implemented changes within ASPeL which enhance our capability to deploy completed work at a quicker pace.
4) The user researcher has played back the findings of the user research that was done on standard protocols improvements work. Thank you to all participants in the research.
5) The design prototype for standard protocols is ready for review.
6) We added a 'revoke' button to enable PIL users who cannot otherwise revoke their Personal Licences when stuck between establishments.
