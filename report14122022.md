## Click here for metrics / progress against plan

We have decided to remove progress metrics from the weekly report. Over time as ASPeL has become a more mature product, the ratio of in-progress to completed tasks has become less useful as a metric. We will continue to share updates on sprint goals, what's in progress and what's just been completed.

The release roadmap has been temporarily removed. As part of the handover from Marvell to the Home Office team it will be reviewed and may be presented in a new format.

## Google Analytics for this report
Google Analytics reporting has been paused for this weekly report. We may re-introduce viewing statistics for the weekly report in future using Google Analytics or another tool.
