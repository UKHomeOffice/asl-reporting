# Summary as of Wednesday 01 February 2023

## New Features!
We've just released some new features to make ASPeL quicker and easier to use!

1. You can now add or edit a condition within an Establishment License amendment task rather than navigating to the License to make the changes.
2. We've included a link to Project License application guidance on the application form

## Planned for Sprint 126 (Greyhound)
1. Improve the experience of adding/amending conditions on licenses for License Holders and Licensing Officers
2. Finish Corporate features (excluding migration) 
3. Decide on the approach for the new Assessments feature


## Things to bear in mind
We welcome our new User Researcher to the team this week!

The Greyhound is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to run at speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph)!


## Work in progress
* Research into the Assessment documentation process
* Improvements to Category E (training) license process
* Develop Corporate entity changes
* Finish development of Manage Conditions feature
