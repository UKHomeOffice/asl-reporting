Interesting facts about red kites: They have relatively weak talons, therefore, they mainly feed on carrion and can often be seen soaring over roads looking for roadkill




# This Sprint, we:
1)	Added 13 new functionalities, including a bug fix to the CAT-E Pils, all behind a feature flag, therefore not yet available to users.
2)	We continue to work on the Named Persons role nomination improvement on the inspectors' user pages, these are also behind a feature flag
