### These are the areas of focus for the current sprint
1. Technical tasks / technical debt
2. Deliver first prototype of PEL Condition feature
3. Bringing service documentation in line with Home Office standards
4. Preparing new features for delivery in the new year (get things 'ready to start')


## Things to bear in mind
Did you know a Dugong's brain accounts for around 0.1% of its body mass? We've decided to extend the Dugong sprint until 16th December 2022 rather than planning a new sprint just before the Christmas and New Year holiday period. New sprints will be planned in the new year from 5th January 2023 onwards. We've added a sprint goal to get new features 'ready to start' through research, business analysis and design.

We'll pause design and research activity as well as new feature development between 19th December 2022 and 5th January 2023. Bug fixing and technical support will continue as usual. 

There will be a product demo of the new Suspend License feature at the next ASRU all-staff call on 14th December.

## Click here for metrics / progress against plan

We have decided to remove progress metrics from the weekly report. Over time as ASPeL has become a more mature product, the ratio of in-progress to completed tasks has become less useful as a metric. We will continue to share updates on sprint goals, what's in progress and what's just been completed.

The release roadmap has been temporarily removed. As part of the handover from Marvell to the Home Office team it will be reviewed and may be presented in a new format.

## Google Analytics for this report
Google Analytics reporting has been paused for this weekly report. We may re-introduce viewing statistics for the weekly report in future using Google Analytics or another tool.
