### These are the areas of focus for the current sprint
1. Technical tasks / technical debt
2. Deliver first prototype of PEL Condition feature
3. Bringing service documentation in line with Home Office standards


## Things to bear in mind
The weekly report will be delayed next week until Thursday 1st December. This is the first full sprint with the new team! The dugong is easily distinguished from its cousin the manatee (also known as a Sea Cow) by its fluked, dolphin-like tail.

## Just Done
* Stakeholder workshop with ASRU focussed on Document Upload
* Fixed some content errors with lists in notification emails
* Updated the prototyping kit ready for new work
* Tidying up the Node18 updates

## About to Do/Doing
* Document Upload Discovery/Research - research
* Designing how to integrate PPL guidance notes into the forms - design
* Allow changes to PEL conditions as part of a PEL amendment - working software
* Minor content and technical debt fixes - working software

## Click here for metrics / progress against plan

We have decided to remove progress metrics from the weekly report. Over time as ASPeL has become a more mature product, the ratio of in-progress to completed tasks has become less useful as a metric. We will continue to share updates on sprint goals, what's in progress and what's just been completed.

The release roadmap has been temporarily removed. As part of the handover from Marvell to the Home Office team it will be reviewed and may be presented in a new format.

## Google Analytics for this report
Google Analytics reporting has been paused for this weekly report. We may re-introduce viewing statistics for the weekly report in future using Google Analytics or another tool.
