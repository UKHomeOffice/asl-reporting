# Summary as of 30th May 2018 
## What's Blocking us / Issues
* Access to data is still the most important issue facing progress.  Lack of access to data will soon become the single factor which limits the speed of development of the team.

## Just Done
* Tested an amend establishment licence prototype with inspectors
* Tested an amend establishment licence prototype with establishment users
* Developed fully working version of view establishment for both internal and external users

## About to Do/Doing
* Develop and iterate designs for internal view of amendments "inbox"
* Design and test establishment licence "inbox" for establishment users
* Develop the amend establishment licence user journey as working software

## Things to be aware of
* The Alpha service review of the project was last Friday 25th May - we expect to hear output and feedback by early next week
* The team will move back into Lunar House, mostly on the 18th floor by the end of May
