# Summary as of Wednesday 19th April 2023

## New Features

**Corporate Establishments** is now Live! Every Establishment License will now either be categorised as 'Corporate PEL' or 'Individual PEL'.

Corporate PELs have a Named Person Responsible for Compliance but will also now be required to provide contact details for an individual legally responsible for the company or organisation (such as a company secretary).

Individual PEL Establishment Licenses have a PEL Holder, who is the legally responsible person.
