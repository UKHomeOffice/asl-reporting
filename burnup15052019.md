## Note about the burnup chart
The burnup chart is showing that we are on course to deliver functionality for when it is required. Note the overall amount of work required for release has increased. Further work maybe discovered as we get closer.

We also expect to spend any time between completion of functionality required and the end-of-August deadline testing and fixing any issues that are identified with the new system.
