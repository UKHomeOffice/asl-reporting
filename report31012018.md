# Summary as of 31th January 2018

## What is Blocking Us / Issues
* Access to the building is still a substantial blocker - this is the fifth week that we have reported it as a problem. Until it is resolved most of the team are forced to work from home.

## Just Done
* Governance meeting - review of progress in January 2018 completed
* Creation of initial user journey designs for the "View Establishment Licence"
* Planning of further user research sessions with universities and companies

## About to Do/Doing
* One more week of "Releaes Zero" set-up tasks before development sprints start
* Preparation of user stories and designs for development sprints to start Wednesday 7th 

## Things to be aware of
* This is a slightly abbreviated report because we have moved reporting from Fridays to Wednesdays to align with reporting across Home Office Digital
* This is week 5
