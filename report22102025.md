Interesting facts about quetzals: quetzals are vividly coloured birds; males feature bright metallic green or blue with deep red on the chest and belly, while females have less vibrant hues of similar colours.

# This Sprint, we:
•	Enabled HBA document replacement without amendment.
•	Added notifications for: applications (submitted, rejected, returned, approved, or removed), NACWO/NVS training due, HOLC role/inspector submissions, NTCOs and nominees    overdue training, and updates for removal refused/returned.
•	Investigated flag behaviour when comments are added to project applications.
•	Introduced a new panel for 'Courses and category E PILs'.
•	Improved Named Persons features: fixed misaligned NACWO checkboxes, ensured NVS data privacy, added NIO/NTCO declarations, updated the 'Before you nominate' screen.
