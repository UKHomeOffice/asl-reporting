# Project Burnup Chart

## Recalculation of Burnup Chart
We've changed the way that we calculate the burnup with the aim of:
* Getting a better idea of when the project is likely to complete
* Maintaining the confidence of the team in the way that the burnup is calculated

However the result of this is recalculation is that the figures for this week alone don't make that much sense.  The burnup chart will return next week when we have more figures using the new system.
