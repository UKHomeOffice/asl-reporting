# Summary as of 14th February 2018

## What is Blocking Us / Issues
* Lack of access to Lunar House because of some members of the team are waiting for security clearance is still an impediment. This has been addressed by the acquisition of temporary accommodation in Landsdowne Road - just a few minutes from Lunar House.

# Just Done
* Agreed a revised recruitment approach and plan has been agreed with representatives of HOLCs (Home Office Liaison Contacts) 
* Remote pilot user research session has been agreed with representatives of HOLCS for 22nd Feb
* Interaction Design: explored design concepts for View Establishment Licence story with Team
* Interaction Design: reviewed examples of existing establishment licences
* Draft Entity Schema [Link to file](graphs/LicenceSchema.pdf)
* Created mock data objects with “real-looking” test and development data to match schema, based on real establishment licences but for the fictional "University of Croydon"

## About to Do/Doing
* Target dates for the sessions with HOLCs are now 27th, 28th of Feb. The location will be determined once we decide the users who will be tested

## Things to be aware of
* This is week 7 that the team has been working together
* This report is mid-sprint so many tasks are currently in progress
